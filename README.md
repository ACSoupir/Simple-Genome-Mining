# Simple-Genome-Mining
Simple script to take *.fasta annotation files and compares that to a characteristic key for whether individual annotation files displayed a phenotype or not. Hypothetical proteins are removed and then the positive phenotype is compared to the negative phenotype for the difference in genome annotated genes.
